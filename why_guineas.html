                        Why Guineas?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Adult guineas are voracious grasshopper eaters! They will also eat ticks and small snakes. We’ve seen them chase large snakes away!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Guineas tend to make a lot of noise when a stranger or a strange critter comes around, so they are good “watchdogs”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether you have a farm, vineyard or a large garden, guineas have huge benefits on a practical level, and will more than make up for their initial cost.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Guineas are generally fully-grown at 16 weeks of age, and will begin laying eggs after about 6 months.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although guinea eggs are smaller in size to chicken eggs (3 guinea eggs = 2 normal-sized chicken eggs), they are much higher in protein, and quite tasty, especially in pastries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Guinea meat is all dark meat and delicious.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And, lastly, guineas are good entertainment! With some extra time and effort you just might even have a good guinea pet.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>
                        Guineas as pets
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Since guineas are game birds they are wilder than most other domestic poultry. As a result, if you want a “pet guinea” it’s going to take more effort, but it’s well worth it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each bird needs to be at least 4 times per day, for 15 minutes to a ½ hour at a time. (For sure you’ll be checking their little butts for pasting!—see Claude’s Keet Care for how to take of this necessary chore!)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Give them a treat, such as white millet or a bit of apple. Let the apple bits turn brown before you give it to them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The more attention you give them, the tamer your guineas will be! The pets will sit on your shoulder, ride on your arm and fly to you when you come outside.
                    </p>
