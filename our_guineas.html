                            Our Guineas
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Heritage Farm currently maintains a superior flock of 180 Helmeted Guineafowl, in a variety of colors.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because Heritage Farm guineas are truly something special, we decided to begin sharing our keets with the general public in 2003.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Heritage Farm is a small guinea hatchery, so each of our birds gets pristine care and a lot of personal attention.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each guinea and chicken on our farm is tested annually for pullorum and typhoid by a certified state inspector. We are also a part of the prestigious Texas A&amp;M NPIP program (National Poultry Improvement Plan).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We take pride in hatching healthy, vigorous keets that will grow into healthy, active adult birds.
                        </p>
                        <h2>
                            Availability
                        </h2>

    
                        <p>Heritage Farm has over 300 customers on our mailing list. We currently supply 12 local feed stores with keets during the primary hatching season (April – June).
                        </p>
                        <p>We usually have keets available from late April until mid October. We normally will have 50 – 75 one-year old adult birds available for sale in late June, and they go fast!
                        </p>
                        <p>Guineas generally do not lay eggs from mid-October until mid-March. During this period we keep them active and in prime shape for the next laying season. Well, we might eat a few, they are just that good.
                    </p>

                        <p>Because we prefer very personalized interaction with our customers, and for the safety of our keets during transport, we do not ship our birds. Contact us, and your keets will be ready for pickup at the Heritage Farm on an appointment-only basis. You’ll get a chance to see exactly where and how your guineas have been raised!
                        </p><p>When picking up your keets, please bring a small cardboard box with a lid (a 12” x 12” x 6” deep will easily transport 30 three-day old keets), or a small pet carrier with an old bath towel or paper towels for the bottom. Your keets need some traction during transport to their new home. Call or email for current pricing and availability.
